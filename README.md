# week-3-game
Game for week three homework

# Grateful Dead hang man
#basis for words will be band members
#albums, songs, or people, places,  
# venues that are part of Grateful Dead history


# puzzleLogic and hangman frame are based nealy entirely on 
# Ahmed's YouTube explanation
# currently does not award wins or display updates to 
# puzzle blanks  -- can't figure out why

# originalattempt.js, indexoriginal.html and index.html are the orginal 
# efforts for the HW assignment with some integration of Ahmed's logic
# but it does not work either
